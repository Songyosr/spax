# Abstract

This paper introduces an iterative spatial accessibility model for
health services planning, inspired by the Enhanced Three-Step Floating
Catchment Area (E3SFCA) model. By integrating features from E2SFCA and
Huff modeling for demand selection, the model estimates a single
distance decay parameter ($\sigma$) from observed utilization data. This
approach combines stochastic demand allocation with iterative
rebalancing of supply and demand to achieve equilibrium in accessibility
patterns. We employ a Poisson log-likelihood optimization framework for
parameter estimation and discuss its implications for localized and
regional planning. The proposed method bridges theoretical advancements
and practical applications in spatial accessibility analysis.

# Introduction

Spatial accessibility measures are essential tools in health services
research, urban planning, and transportation studies. They provide
insights into how easily populations can access facilities and services,
which is critical for effective resource allocation and planning.
However, these measures often rely on parameters such as distance decay
that are difficult to determine and heavily influence the outcomes.

Traditional models, such as the Two-Step Floating Catchment Area (2SFCA)
and its enhanced versions like the E2SFCA and E3SFCA (Luo et al., 2014),
attempt to address these challenges but often depend on assumptions that
may not hold across different contexts. In particular, selecting and
calibrating the distance decay function remains a recurring issue, as it
governs how accessibility diminishes with increasing distance.

This paper presents a novel iterative spatial accessibility model that
extends the E3SFCA framework by incorporating probabilistic demand
allocation through Huff modeling. The model introduces a single distance
decay parameter ($\sigma$) and employs a Poisson log-likelihood
optimization to estimate it from observed utilization data. By
iteratively balancing demand and supply, the model aims to achieve a
stable equilibrium that reflects real-world accessibility patterns more
accurately. This approach not only advances the theoretical foundation
of spatial accessibility but also provides practical tools for
policymakers and researchers.

# Model Framework

# Model Framework

may - be discuss abit on the E3SFCA and discuss how does it works before
goin into our framework

## Notation and Definitions

-   $I$: Set of demand points (e.g., patient residences)
-   $J$: Set of facilities (e.g., health centers)
-   $D_i$: Population (or total demand) at location $i \in I$
-   $S_j$: Service capacity at facility $j \in J$
-   $d_{ij}$: Distance (or travel time) between location $i$ and
    facility $j$
-   $Huff_{ij}$: choice probability of demand point $i$ choosing
    facility $j$, if they were to visit a facility
-   $f(d_{ij}; \sigma)$: A distance decay function parameterized by
    $\sigma$. The function $f$ can be any monotonically decreasing
    function with respect to distance, such as an exponential or
    Gaussian form: $$
    f(d_{ij}; \sigma) = \exp\left(-\frac{d_{ij}}{\sigma}\right)
    \quad \text{or} \quad
    f(d_{ij}; \sigma) = \exp\left(-\frac{d_{ij}^2}{2\sigma^2}\right),
    $$ depending on modeling preferences.
-   $O_j$: Observed utilization at facility $j$. This could be the
    number of patients who actually visited the facility from all demand
    points.
-   $U_j$: Predicted utilization at facility $j$ based on the model
    parameters and demand distribution

## Conceptual Approach

Instead of looking at the spatial access problem as a static snapshot,
we consider it as an stochastic process in which demand chooses supply
based on a perceived available capacity and distance decay at that time,
which in turn affects the actual utilization. The model is an iterative
process that converges to a stable set of choice probabilities and
expected demands.

The process involves two nested loops:

1.  **Huff-Based Relative Preferences**:\
    For each demand location $i$, we first consider how it would
    allocate its population $P_i$ among the facilities if all of them
    were equally and fully available. We use a Huff model to determine a
    baseline "choice" distribution: $$
    Huff_{ij} = \frac{Attr_j f(d_{ij}; \sigma)}{\sum_{k \in J} Attr_k f(d_{ik}; \sigma)},
    $$

    where $Attr_j$ is an initial attractiveness of facility $j$. This
    Huff probabilities satisfy:

    $$
    \sum_{j \in J} Huff_{ij} = 1 \quad \forall i \in I.
    $$

    Intuitively, $Huff_{ij}$ represents the probability that individuals
    at $i$ would choose facility $j$ ***if*** they were to visit a
    facility.

2.  **Distance Decay Realization**:\
    The Huff probabilities describe relative choice, but not all
    "intended" demand may actually realize into visits due to friction
    or other factors. The distance decay function $f(d_{ij}; \sigma)$ is
    already included in the Huff model, reducing the relative share of
    distant facilities. If we think of the Huff model as giving a
    "normalized" preference, the real challenge is to find an
    equilibrium where facility capacity and actual utilization match.

3.  **Iterative Equilibrium Computation (Inner Loop)**:\
    Given a fixed $\sigma$, we find a stable set of choice probabilities
    $P(i \to j)$ and expected utilization $E[U_j]$ that are consistent
    with both the capacity constraints and the observed spatial
    patterns. We do this by iterative scaling:

    **3.1 Initialization (**$t = 0$):

    $$
    (1)\qquad   Attr_j^{(0)} = S_j \qquad 
    $$

    At the starting point, we make a simple assumption that the
    facility's attractiveness is proportional to its full capacity, yet
    to be utilized. This means that if any potential demand from $i$
    were to visit a facility, they would access to all service available
    at that facility.

    From that, we can derived the initial choice probabilities:

    $$ 
    (2)\qquad Huff_{ij}^{(0)} = \frac{S_j f(d_{ij}; \sigma)}{\sum_{k \in J} S_k f(d_{ik}; \sigma)} 
    $$

    Combining (2) with a distance decay function, we can get the
    probability of demand $i$ ***utilizing*** facility $j$ at time
    $t = 0$:

    $$
    (3)\qquad P(i \to j)^{(0)} = Huff_{ij}^{(0)} \cdot f(d_{ij}; \sigma)
    $$

    And, by summing over all demand points, we can get the initial
    expected demand at facility $j$ - this set up is similar to the
    E3SFCA model (Luo et al., 2017):

    $$
    (4)\qquad E[U_j]^{(0)} = \sum_{i \in I} D_i P(i \to j)^{(0)}
    $$

    **3.2 Iterative Steps** (for $t = 1,2,\ldots$):

    a.  **Update the supply availability**: Given the expected demand
        $E[U_j]^{(t-1)}$, we can now adjust the effective supply of each
        facility $j$ to reflect whether it was over- or under-selected
        in the previous iteration:

        $$
        R_j^{(t)} = \frac{S_j}{E[U_j]^{(t-1)}}
        $$

    b.  **Update Accessibility**: Like in normal a 2sfca-family method,
        we calculate the accessibility for each location $k$ to each
        center $j$ by multiplying the distance decay function with the
        adjusted supply:

        $$
        A_{kj}^{(t)} = R_j^{(t)} f(d_{kj}; \sigma).
        $$

        and that the total access for location $k$ is:

        $$
        A_k^{(t)} = \sum_{j \in J} A_{kj}^{(t)} = \sum_{j \in J} R_j^{(t)} f(d_{kj}; \sigma)
        $$

    c.  **Update Attractiveness**: Now, we can treat $R_{j}^{(t)}$ as
        the new attractiveness factor of each facility. But to prevent
        the risk of oscillating demand when two or more centers keep
        "stealing" demand from each other, we add a learning rate,
        $\lambda$, which represents a fraction of the change in the
        attractiveness from the previous iteration. So the new
        attractiveness is:

        $$
        Attr_j^{(t)} = (1 - \lambda) Attr_j^{(t-1)} + \lambda R_j^{(t)}
        $$

        which can also represent a delay in the demand realization of
        change in supply.

    d.  **Update Choice Utilizing Probabilities**: we can then update
        the choice probabilities as a function of the new attractiveness
        and the distance decay function:

        $$
        Huff_{ij}^{(t)} = \frac{Attr_{ij}^{(t)}}{\sum_{k \in J} Attr_{ik}^{(t)}} 
        \newline
        P(i \to j)^{(t)} = Huff_{ij}^{(t)} \cdot f(d_{kj}; \sigma)
        $$

    e.  **recompute Expected Utilization**: We can now update the
        expected utilization at each facility:

        $$
        E[U_j]^{(t)} = \sum_{i \in I} D_i P(i \to j)^{(t)}
        $$

    f.  **Convergence Check**: Repeat until: $$
        \max_j |E[U_j]^{(t)} - E[U_j]^{(t-1)}| < \epsilon_T.
        $$ Once converged, we have a stable set of $P(i \to j)$ and
        $E[U_j]$ for the given $\sigma$.

## Parameter Estimation (Outer Loop)

We seek the $\sigma$ that best matches observed utilization $O_j$. Let
$E[U_j](\sigma)$ be the equilibrium expected utilization at facility $j$
for a given $\sigma$. We assume $O_j$ are observed counts, and model
them using a Poisson distribution: $$
P(O_j | E[U_j](\sigma)) = \frac{(E[U_j](\sigma))^{O_j} e^{-E[U_j](\sigma)}}{O_j!}.
$$

The log-likelihood is: $$
L(\sigma) = \sum_{j \in J} \log P(O_j | E[U_j](\sigma)) = \sum_{j \in J} \left[
O_j \log(E[U_j](\sigma)) - E[U_j](\sigma) - \log(O_j!) \right].
$$

We find $\sigma$ that maximizes $L(\sigma)$.

**Procedure**:

1.  **Initialize** $\sigma^{(0)}$.

2.  **At Iteration** $k$:

    -   Run the inner loop to find $E[U_j](\sigma^{(k)})$ at
        equilibrium.
    -   Compute $L(\sigma^{(k)})$.
    -   Estimate $\frac{\partial L}{\partial \sigma}$ using analytic or
        numerical methods. For example: $$
        \frac{\partial L}{\partial \sigma} = \sum_{j \in J} \left[
        \frac{O_j - E[U_j](\sigma)}{E[U_j](\sigma)} \right]
        \frac{\partial E[U_j](\sigma)}{\partial \sigma}.
        $$

3.  **Update** $\sigma$: $$
    \sigma^{(k+1)} = \sigma^{(k)} + \eta_\sigma \frac{\partial L}{\partial \sigma}(\sigma^{(k)}),
    $$ where $\eta_\sigma$ is a step size or use a more sophisticated
    optimizer like Newton-Raphson or BFGS.

4.  **Convergence**: If
    $|\sigma^{(k+1)} - \sigma^{(k)}| < \epsilon_\sigma$, stop.
    Otherwise, repeat until convergence.

## Interpretations

-   $\sigma$: The decay parameter $\sigma$ determines how quickly
    accessibility falls off with distance. A small $\sigma$ implies a
    steep decay—demand is strongly deterred by distance, leading to
    highly localized utilization patterns. A large $\sigma$ implies a
    gentler decay, allowing facilities to draw patients from farther
    away.

-   **No Outside Option**: Unlike models that rely on a baseline $a_0$
    to allow for unserved demand, this approach naturally produces
    unserved demand. If the distance decay is sufficiently strong, not
    all $P_i$ will manifest as utilization $O_j$. The equilibrium
    probabilities reflect this shortfall without needing an extra
    parameter.
