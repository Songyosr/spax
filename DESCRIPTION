Description: A comprehensive toolkit for analyzing spatial accessibility to healthcare 
    facilities using enhanced two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) methods. 
    The package provides functions for calculating catchment areas, processing 
    population demand, and evaluating healthcare facility accessibility. Key features 
    include Monte Carlo simulation for uncertainty analysis, flexible distance decay 
    functions, parallel processing capabilities, and support for multiple supply-side 
    indicators. Designed for healthcare planning and spatial equity analysis, 
    but applicable to other spatial accessibility contexts.
