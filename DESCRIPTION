Description: A fresh take on spatial accessibility analysis that combines modular design 
    with raster-based computation. Like LEGO bricks for spatial analysis, the package 
    provides building blocks for the family of the two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA)
    analysis that you can mix and match. Built around continuous surfaces rather than 
    discrete points, 'spax' makes it easy to work with high-resolution population data 
    and complex service areas. Features include flexible distance decay functions, 
    Monte Carlo simulation for uncertainty analysis, and support for multiple supply 
    indicators. Whether you're planning healthcare services or analyzing coffee shop 
    coverage, 'spax' helps you build the analysis you need.
