\title{spax: Modular Raster-Based Spatial Accessibility Analysis}
\description{
A fresh take on spatial accessibility analysis that combines modular design with raster-based computation. Like LEGO bricks for spatial analysis, the package provides building blocks for the family of the two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) analysis that you can mix and match. Built around continuous surfaces rather than discrete points, 'spax' makes it easy to work with high-resolution population data and complex service areas. Features include flexible distance decay functions, Monte Carlo simulation for uncertainty analysis, and support for multiple supply indicators. Whether you're planning healthcare services or analyzing coffee shop coverage, 'spax' helps you build the analysis you need.
