\title{spax: An R Package for Modularized (Hopefully) Spatial Accessibility Analysis}
\description{
A comprehensive toolkit for analyzing spatial accessibility to healthcare facilities using enhanced two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) methods. The package provides functions for calculating catchment areas, processing population demand, and evaluating healthcare facility accessibility. Key features include Monte Carlo simulation for uncertainty analysis, flexible distance decay functions, parallel processing capabilities, and support for multiple supply-side indicators. Designed for healthcare planning and spatial equity analysis, but applicable to other spatial accessibility contexts.
