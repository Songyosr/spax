\format{
Both datasets are sf objects with point geometry (UTM zone 47N, EPSG:32647)
containing the following variables:
\describe{
  \item{id}{Unique identifier for each facility (unordered!)}
  \item{hoslvl}{Factor indicating facility level:
        "1-Community", "2-General", "3-Regional"}
  \item{bed}{Number of hospital beds}
  \item{s_doc}{Number of doctors}
  \item{s_dent}{Number of dentists}
  \item{s_nurse}{Number of nurses}
  \item{s_hv}{Number of health volunteers}
  \item{d_pop_moph}{Total population in service area}
  \item{d_pop_moph_60}{Population aged 60 and above in service area}
  \item{d_pop_moph_05}{Population aged 0-5 in service area}
  \item{geometry}{Point geometry representing facility location}

The dataset combines three main data sources from the MoPH API:
\itemize{
  \item Facility locations and characteristics (GIS service)
  \item Healthcare provider statistics
  \item Population and service area statistics
}
}
\description{
A collection of spatial datasets containing information about health facilities
in Thailand's Region 12 (Southern Border Provinces) for the year 2020 (B.E. 2563).
The data is split into two complementary datasets: primary health centers (PHC)
and hospitals.
}
\details{
The data is split into two datasets:

\strong{hc12_phc}: Primary Health Centers (n=819)
\itemize{
  \item All facilities are level "1-Community"
  \item No inpatient beds (bed = 0)
  \item Typically staffed by 1-4 healthcare providers
  \item Strong health volunteer presence (s_hv > 0)
  \item Serves defined population catchments
}

\strong{hc12_hos}: Hospitals (n=77)
\itemize{
  \item Includes general (level 2) and regional hospitals (level 3)
  \item Has inpatient beds (30-591 beds)
  \item Larger healthcare workforce
  \item Limited health volunteer involvement
  \item Population data not available at facility level
}
}
\note{
Variables are prefixed to indicate their type:
\itemize{
  \item 's_': Supply indicators (healthcare workforce)
  \item 'd_': Demand indicators (population statistics)
}
}
